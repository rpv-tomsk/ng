This is written in the comments in png.c:

/* Untangle the "-quality" setting:

     Undefined is 0; the default is used.
     Default is 75

     10's digit:

        0 or omitted: Use Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY strategy with the
           zlib default compression level

        1-9: the zlib compression level

     1's digit:

        0-4: the PNG filter method

        5:   libpng adaptive filtering if compression level > 5
             libpng filter type "none" if compression level <= 5
                or if image is grayscale or palette

        6:   libpng adaptive filtering

        7:   "LOCO" filtering (intrapixel differing) if writing
             a MNG, otherwise "none".  Did not work in IM-6.7.0-9
             and earlier because of a missing "else".

        8:   Z_RLE strategy (or Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY if quality < 10), adaptive
             filtering. Unused prior to IM-6.7.0-10, was same as 6

        9:   Z_RLE strategy (or Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY if quality < 10), no PNG filters
             Unused prior to IM-6.7.0-10, was same as 6

    Note that using the -quality option, not all combinations of
    PNG filter type, zlib compression level, and zlib compression
    strategy are possible.  This is addressed by using
    "-define png:compression-strategy", etc., which takes precedence
    over -quality.
